# 🐾 PetStore — Java Mini Project

This is my first **Java practice project**, built while learning variables and basic operations.  
The project simulates a simple pet store where we keep track of animals, update sales, and calculate revenue.

---

## 📖 What I Learned
- Declaring and initializing variables (`int`, `double`, `String`)
- Performing arithmetic operations to update variables
- Using `System.out.println()` to display output
- Simulating real-world logic (selling pets, updating revenue)

---

## 💻 How It Works
- The program starts with a certain number of dogs and cats.
- Each time a dog or cat is sold:
  - The number of animals decreases.
  - The store’s revenue increases.
- New animals can also be added.

---

## 📝 Example Output
```

Welcome to the Pet Store!
Happy pets
Dogs left: 5
Cats left: 6
Total revenue: 310.0

````

## 🚀 Next Steps
As I continue learning Java, I’ll extend this project to include:
- Classes and objects (`Dog`, `Cat`, `Store`)
- Methods to handle sales and purchases
- Loops to simulate multiple transactions
- Arrays or collections for managing different pets

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone this repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/PetStore.git
````

2. Navigate into the project folder

   ```bash
   cd PetStore
   ```
3. Compile and run the program

   ```bash
   javac PetStore.java
   java PetStore
   ```
